    /// Implements polynomial math for polynomials over a galois field with characteristic 2 (a binary
    /// galois field), with restrictions on the practical size of the field.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This paper has a Reed Solomon-relevant intro to GFs:
    /// http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP031.pdf
    ///
    /// A Galois field is an arithmetical field that is:
    ///   - Finite: Arithmetic operations are defined for only the elements defined to be in the field,
    ///             and there are a finite number of elements.
    ///   - Closed: Arithmetic operations on elements of the field return a value also in the field.
    ///
    /// A Galois field's size is a parameter of the field, but only certain sizes can exist. The
    /// field must be a size = p^k where p is prime and k is a positive integer. p is also called the
    /// characteristic of the field.
    ///
    /// A Galois field is composed of an additive group and a multiplicative group - what it means to
    /// perform addition or multiplication in the field depends on the definitions of these groups for
    /// the field in question - the choice of what meaning to use is up to the designer of the field.
    /// However, both groups must meet the requirements for operations in a Galois field - they must be
    /// finite and closed.
    ///
    /// One such possible definition for addition over GF(p) (where p is prime) could be `z = (x + y) mod p`.
    /// Another might be `z = a XOR b` where XOR represents the bitwise exclusive-or operation. Both of these
    /// definitions are sufficient for defining the meaning of addition in a Galois field.
    ///
    /// The same is true for defining multiplication - in GF(p), multiplication could be defined as
    /// `z = (x * y ) mod p` - such a definition is finite and closed.
    ///
    /// A Galois field need not be defined simply over a prime number of elements - it is possible
    /// to define a Galois field GF(p^n) (where p is prime and n is > 1), however, providing definitions for
    /// addition and multiplication prove a bit tricky - particularly, multiplication is the trouble maker.
    /// Our go-to definition for multiplication over such a field might be `z = (x * y) mod p^k`, however
    /// such a definition is not sufficient - the ring of integers modulo p^k doesn't meet the definition of
    /// a field.
    ///
    /// Instead, however, we can define the multiplicative group for our finite field in a different manner.
    /// What if we treated the elements of GF(p^n) as polynomials over the field GF(p)? Each element in GF(p^n)
    /// would be decomposed into a set of elements in GF(p), and those elements would be used as coefficients
    /// for a polynomial over GF(p).
    ///
    /// Consider a galois field that uses characteristic '2', such as GF(2^4). Such a field has 16 elements, and
    /// we could consider each element as a set of elements from GF(2) - we could consider them by their bits.
    ///
    /// For instance, the element '14' from GF(2^4) could be decomposed into binary '1110'. Now we could
    /// represent the element '14' from GF(2^4) as the polynomial '1x^3 + 1x^2 + 1x^1 + 0x^0' from GF(2).
    ///
    /// Let's keep that in our pocket for now.
    ///
    /// In Galois Fields, non-zero elements of the field form a multiplicative group that is also a cyclic
    /// group. For certain elements of the field, successive powers of these elements form a cyclic group
    /// that contains the entire set of non-zero elements in the field. These elements are called primitive
    /// elements, usually denoted as some value 'a'. Since successive powers of these elements forms
    /// a complete cyclic group containing all non-zero elements of the field - all elements are
    /// represented, and represented only once - we can represent the elements of the field indexed
    /// by the power of some primitive element a, since we can guarantee that there is a one-to-one
    /// mapping from some power a^i to some element in the field. The field can be represented in
    /// an alternate representation { 0, a^0, a^1, ..., a^(n-2) }, which is particularly useful when
    /// defining multiplication in some GF(p^n) as polynomials over GF(p).
    ///
    /// For example, consider GF(5) - this is a prime group, so we can choose to define arithmetic as
    /// simply being addition modulo p and multiplication modulo p.
    ///
    /// The elements of GF(5) are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. 2 + 4 = 6 mod 5 = 1. 2 * 4 = 8 mod 5 = 3.
    ///
    /// Lets test to see if the element 2 in GF(5) is also a primitive element:
    ///   - 2^1 =  2
    ///   - 2^2 =  4
    ///   - 2^3 =  8 mod 5 = 3
    ///   - 2^4 = 16 mod 5 = 1
    ///
    /// Each element was generated, and generated only once, thus the element 2 in GF(5) is primitive in GF(5).
    /// We can now write the elements of GF(5) indexed by a=2:
    ///  {0, a^0, a^1, a^2, a^3} =
    ///  {0    1    2,   4,   3}
    ///
    /// Consider the field GF(7) equipped with addition/multiplication modulo 7, and see if 2 is a primitive element:
    ///  - 2^0 = 1
    ///  - 2^1 = 2
    ///  - 2^2 = 4
    ///  - 2^3 = 8 mod 7 = 1    xxx
    ///
    /// 2 in GF(7) forms a cyclic group {2, 4, 1}, but isn't a complete cyclic group,
    /// and thus is not a primitive element in GF(7).
    ///
    /// --
    ///
    /// Recall that we don't currently have a definition for how to perform arithmetic on elements
    /// from some arbitrary field GF(p^k), since our go-to operator modulus doesn't fit the bill -
    /// the ring of integers modulo p^k doesn't meet the definitions for a field.
    ///
    /// However, we *can* use modulus to define arthimetic on Galois Fields of the form GF(p). Then, we
    /// can use polynomials over GF(p), which we are now equiped to compute, as the basis for defining
    /// arithmetic over some arbitrary GF(p^k).
    ///
    /// A polynomial over some arbitrary GF(x) has polynomial coefficients that are elements of GF(x).
    /// Consider the following equation of polynomials over the GF(5) that is using modulus to define
    /// arithmetic:
    ///    ( 3x^2 + x + 2 ) + ( 3x^2 + x + 3) = ( 6x^2 + 2x + 5 ) = ( x^2 + 2x + 0 )
    ///
    /// We can represent *elements* of GF(p^k) as *polynomials* over GF(p).
    /// For instance, element '7' in GF(2^4) would be the following polynomial over GF(2):
    ///    0x^3 + 1x^2 + 1x + 1.
    ///
    /// And element '10' would be the polynomial:
    ///    1x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x + 0
    ///
    /// We can then add those two polynomials together according to our definition of arithmetic in GF(2):
    ///    1x^3 + 1x^2 + 2x + 1  which reduces modulo 2 to
    ///    1x^3 + 1x^2 + 0x + 1
    ///
    /// Which, when converted back to an element in GF(2^4) would be 13.
    /// Thus, we've defined elemental addition in GF(2^4) to be polynomial addition in
    /// the system of GF(2) equipped with elemental addition modulu 2.
    ///
    /// We can similarly use GF(2) with modulu to define multiplication in GF(2^4), however, we
    /// run into one little snag - we end up with polynomials with higher-power terms than defined
    /// in GF(2^4):
    ///
    /// Multiply 7 * 6 in GF(2^4):
    ///   (x^2 + x + 1) * (x^2 + x) =
    ///   (x^4 + x^3) + (x^3 + x^2) + (x^2 + x) =
    ///   x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 0 =
    ///   x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + x + 0 =
    ///   x^4 + x
    ///
    /// We're left with this x^4 term that has no representation in GF(2^4).
    ///
    /// However, if we can find a irreducible polynomial in GF(p) that has degree k, then we can
    /// perform polynomial division and use the remainder as the result, effectively, implmenting
    /// polynomial modulus. The irreducible polynomial must have a non-zero term of degree k (it must be monic)
    /// for it to have the reducing strength required to remove polynomial terms that are too high order.
    ///
    /// For GF(2^4), such a polynomial might be x^4 + x + 1
    ///
    /// Thus, we could take our earlier result x^4 + x and reduce it x^4 + x + 1 via polynomial division:
    ///               1
    ///             __________
    /// x^4 + x + 1 | x^4 + x + 0
    ///             - x^4 + x + 1
    ///                 0 + 0 + 1
    ///
    /// And thus, we're left with just 1. This was a polynomial in GF(2), which
    /// we can convert back to an element in GF(2^4), which is simply element 1.
    ///
    /// Thus, for the field GF(2^4), with reducing polynomial x^4 + x + 1,
    ///  7 * 6 = 1.
    ///
    /// We call this reducing polynomial the field generator polynomial p(x).
    ///
    /// --
    ///
    /// The primitive elements of the field GF(p^k) also form roots of all generator polynomials.
    /// For instance, the generator polynomial we chose above:
    ///   p(x) = x^4 + x + 1     -->
    ///   p(a) = a^4 + a + 1 = 0 --->
    ///    a^4 = a + 1
    ///
    /// We have defined addition and multiplication for non-prime field of the form GF(p^k)
    /// by using polynomal representation in GF(p) equipped with modular arithmetic.
    ///
    /// We can use this fact to generate the field of GF(p^k) in terms of the elements { 0, a^0, .., a^(n-2) }
    ///
    /// Suppose we pick 2 as our primitive element for GF(2^4), and use reducing polynomial x^4 + x + 1, and thus
    /// know that a^4 = a + 1
    ///
    ///
    /// a^0 =        = 1
    /// a^1 =        = 2
    /// a^2 =        = 4
    /// a^3 =        = 8
    /// a^4 = a + 1  = 3
    /// a^5 = a(a^4 + 1) = a(a+1) = a^2 + a = 6
    /// ...
    ///
    /// And thus, we can represent the entire field indexed by the power of our primitive element, and implement
    /// multiplication and division using logarithms.
    ///
    /// --
    ///
    /// This design uses the following optimizating restrictions:
    ///  - The field characteristic must be 2; that is the field must be of the form GF(2^m).
    ///  - The generator polynomial is specified in the form of a 32-bit 'int' variable,
    ///    limiting the length of the polynomial to 32 coefficients. This limit will never be
    ///    practically hit, due to the next restriction.
    ///  - Multiplication and division are implemented using a look-up table, for performance.
    ///    Large galois fields require n^2 memory to store the table. For GF(2^8), this is
    ///    256 * 256 == 65536 entries, times 4 bytes per entry = 256 kiB.
